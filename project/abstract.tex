\section*{Abstract}
a few sentences summarizing the document.
This document is a brief abstract about a Big Data project.
\section{Introduction}
context
	The internet of things and sensor network are developping.
	Mining data streams directly on the chip may provide two benefits:
	increasing computing capacity;
	increasing battery efficiency by cutting useless data.
	
objectives
	What we want to do in this project is to provide a library with data stream algorithms.

presentation of the problem to solve
